# Cypress Support Directory

## Overview

The `cypress/support` directory is designed to house support files and configurations for Cypress end-to-end testing. This directory contains setup scripts that execute before (or during) tests, helping to maintain environment consistency and simplify test initialization. The provided configurations streamline the testing process, ensuring tests start from a known state, thereby improving reliability and reducing flakiness.

## Key Components

### 1. `beforeEach.js`

- **Purpose**: To set up a consistent starting point for each test case by navigating to the root URL before each test is executed.
- **Key Functionality**: The `beforeEach` hook provided by Cypress ensures that all tests run in a clean state with the application loaded.

   ```javascript
   beforeEach(() => {
     cy.visit('/')
   })
   ```

### 2. `index.js`

- **Purpose**: This is the main entry point for the support file configuration, importing essential support configurations and initializing them for use in test scenarios.
- **Key Functionality**: It includes third-party support modules, such as code coverage utilities, along with the custom setup file.

   ```javascript
   import '@cypress/code-coverage/support'
   import './beforeEach'
   ```

## Installation/Setup Requirements

To set up the Cypress support directory, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. **Cypress**: Ensure you have Cypress installed in your project. If not, you can install it using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install cypress --save-dev
   ```

2. **Code Coverage Plugin** (_optional_): If you wish to utilize code coverage, the appropriate plugin must be installed. You can do this by executing:

   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev @cypress/code-coverage
   ```

3. After installing the packages, ensure your Cypress directory structure includes the support files in `cypress/support/`.

## Usage Examples

The support files in this directory are loaded automatically by Cypress when executing the test suite. Here are some important usages:

1. **File Initialization**: The `beforeEach.js` file runs before every test, ensuring tests begin with the homepage loaded.

2. **Code Coverage Utilization**: By importing `@cypress/code-coverage/support` in `index.js`, you enable the collection of code coverage metrics for your application, which can be viewed in your coverage reports after tests are completed.

### Example Usage in Tests

```javascript
describe('Homepage Tests', () => {
  it('should load the homepage', () => {
    cy.get('h1').should('contain', 'Welcome');
  });
});
```

In this example, the test will first navigate to the homepage before executing the assertions, thanks to the `beforeEach` setup.

## Important Configuration Notes

- Ensure that your application's base URL is correctly set up in the Cypress configuration (usually found in `cypress.json` or `cypress.config.js`) to use the `cy.visit('/')` command effectively.
- Any additional configuration related to the code coverage plugin should be applied according to its documentation to integrate it properly with your test suite.
- Custom commands or additional hooks can be added to `beforeEach.js` to extend the initial setup for specific test requirements.

By following this README guideline, you can effectively implement, utilize, and modify the Cypress support files for a streamlined testing experience.
