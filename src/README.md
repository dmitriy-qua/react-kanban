# Project README

## Overview

This project is designed to provide functionality for managing a board interface, commonly used in project management tools. The main component `Board` is accompanied by helper functions to manage its state and user interactions. The codebase utilizes Jest for testing, ensuring that both the main component and helper functions are well-integrated and reliable.

## Key Components

- **`Board` Component**: The primary functional component that represents the board interface. It is responsible for displaying and managing tasks organized into columns.
- **Helper Functions**: A collection of utility functions that perform operations related to the board, such as moving columns and cards, adding or removing columns and cards, and changing the properties of columns.

### Exports
- The main entry point `src/index.js` exports the `Board` component as the default export and all helper functions as named exports.
- The public interface includes:
  - `moveColumn`
  - `moveCard`
  - `addColumn`
  - `removeColumn`
  - `changeColumn`
  - `addCard`
  - `removeCard`

## Installation

To set up the project, you'll need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine. Once Node.js is installed, you can clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies as follows:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git

# Navigate into the project directory
cd yourproject

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

## Usage Examples

The exported components and helper functions from this module can be utilized as follows:

1. Importing the `Board` component and helper functions:
    ```javascript
    import Board, { moveColumn, addColumn, removeCard } from 'yourproject';
    ```

2. Using `Board` in your application:
    ```javascript
    function App() {
      return (
        <div>
          <h1>Task Board</h1>
          <Board />
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

3. Using helper functions:
    ```javascript
    const newColumn = addColumn('New Column');
    const updatedState = moveColumn(currentState, columnId, newIndex);
    removeCard(cardId);
    ```

## Testing

The project includes a testing configuration using Jest. The tests are defined in `src/index.spec.js`, which ensures that both the `Board` component and the associated helper functions are correctly exported and function as intended.

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

## Configuration

### ESLint Configuration
The project also includes ESLint configurations for maintaining code quality. The `.eslintrc.json` file specifies the rules and environment settings:

- Extends recommended configurations for Jest.
- Overrides for test files (`*.spec.js`) to include additional rules relevant to testing-library and Jest DOM.

### Important Notes
- It is advisable to ensure your testing environment is configured to support Jest. This includes having the necessary plugins and configurations as outlined in your ESLint setup.
- For visualizing the state of the board, it is recommended to implement additional styles or use a UI library on top of the `Board` component.
