# withDroppable

## Overview

The `withDroppable` higher-order component (HOC) is designed to enhance a React component by wrapping it in a `Droppable` area provided by the `react-beautiful-dnd` library. This feature enables drag-and-drop functionality, allowing users to drop draggable items within a designated area on the user interface.

## Key Components

### `withDroppable(Component)`

- **Purpose**: This function takes a React component as an argument and returns a new component that integrates the `Droppable` functionality.
- **Parameters**:
  - `Component`: A React component that you want to enhance with droppable capabilities.
  
- **Return Value**: A wrapper component that makes use of `Droppable` from `react-beautiful-dnd`, providing it with droppable properties and rendering the inner component.

### `WrapperComponent`

The returned component by `withDroppable`:

- **Props**:
  - `children`: Any nested JSX elements that will be rendered inside the droppable component.
  - `...droppableProps`: Extra props that will be spread onto the `Droppable`, allowing customization (like `droppableId`, `direction`, etc.).

- **Functionality**: It renders the `Component` passed to `withDroppable`, passing down the droppable props while also maintaining a reference to the droppable area and rendering the necessary placeholder.

## Installation

To use `withDroppable`, make sure to have the `react-beautiful-dnd` package installed in your project. You can install it via npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install react-beautiful-dnd
```

or 

```bash
yarn add react-beautiful-dnd
```

## Usage Examples

Hereâ€™s how to use the `withDroppable` HOC in your application:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import withDroppable from './withDroppable';

const MyDroppableComponent = withDroppable(({ children, ...props }) => {
  return <div {...props}>{children}</div>;
});

// Using the MyDroppableComponent in your application
const App = () => {
  return (
    <MyDroppableComponent droppableId="droppable-1">
      <div>This is a droppable area!</div>
    </MyDroppableComponent>
  );
};

export default App;
```

## Important Features

- **Seamless Integration**: Easily integrate droppable areas into your existing components without having to rewrite significant amounts of code.
- **Flexibility**: `withDroppable` accepts any React component and turns it into a droppable area. You can wrap basic HTML elements or custom components.

## Configuration and Important Notes

- Make sure to provide unique `droppableId` props when you have multiple droppable areas in a single application to prevent conflicts.
- The HOC is tested to ensure that it properly renders the component while providing drag-and-drop functionality. Refer to the attached test cases for validation of functionality.
- If you're using TypeScript, remember to set appropriate types for props passed to `withDroppable` for type safety and better development experience.

## Testing

The HOC has been tested using Jest and React Testing Library to ensure correct rendering and behavior. The following test verifies that the droppable wrapper component renders correctly with the provided children.

```javascript
import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
import withDroppable from './';

describe('#withDroppable', () => {
  let subject;

  beforeEach(() => {
    const Droppable = withDroppable('span');
    subject = render(
      <Droppable>
        <div id='children' />
      </Droppable>
    );
  });

  afterEach(() => {
    subject = undefined;
  });

  it('returns a droppable component', () => {
    expect(subject.container.querySelector('span > #children')).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(subject.container.querySelector('span > #placeholder')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```
