# Board Services

## Overview

The Board Services module provides utility functions for managing the positioning of columns and cards within a board interface. This module is designed to facilitate drag-and-drop features, allowing users to move cards between columns and rearrange columns within the board.

## Key Components

The following functions comprise the main functionality of this module:

- **`getCoordinates(event, board)`**: Extracts movement coordinates for columns or cards based on the drag-and-drop event data.
- **`isAColumnMove(type)`**: Determines if the drag-and-drop event is a column movement.
- **`getCard(board, sourceCoordinate)`**: Retrieves a card from the board given its position and column.
- **`getColumn(board, droppableId)`**: Finds a column in the board based on its identifier.
- **`isMovingAColumnToAnotherPosition(coordinates)`**: Checks if a column is being moved to another position within the same column.
- **`isMovingACardToAnotherPosition(coordinates)`**: Verifies if a card is being moved to a different position or different column.

## Installation

Ensure you have a JavaScript environment set up with Node.js. The Board Services can be integrated with your existing project by cloning or importing the source code. You can link or copy the `src/components/Board/services` directory into your codebase.

```bash
# Clone the repository (if applicable)
git clone <repository-url>

# Navigate to the directory
cd <repository-directory>/src/components/Board/services
```

## Usage

To use the services provided by this module, first import the required functions:

```javascript
import {
  getCoordinates,
  isAColumnMove,
  getCard,
  isMovingAColumnToAnotherPosition,
  isMovingACardToAnotherPosition,
} from './services/index';
```

### Examples

#### Get Coordinates

To get the coordinates of a column or card movement:

```javascript
const event = {
  type: 'CARD',
  source: { index: 0, droppableId: '1' },
  destination: { index: 1, droppableId: '2' },
};

const board = {
  columns: [
    { id: 1, cards: [{ id: 1 }] },
    { id: 2, cards: [{ id: 2 }] },
  ],
};

const coordinates = getCoordinates(event, board);
console.log(coordinates);
// Output: { source: { fromColumnId: 1, fromPosition: 0 }, destination: { toColumnId: 2, toPosition: 1 } }
```

#### Determine Column Movement

To check if an event represents a column move:

```javascript
const isColumnMove = isAColumnMove(event.type);
console.log(isColumnMove); // Output: true or false
```

#### Retrieve a Card

To get a specific card from the board based on its coordinates:

```javascript
const card = getCard(board, { fromColumnId: 1, fromPosition: 0 });
console.log(card); // Output: { id: 1 }
```

#### Check Movement Type

To check if a column or card is being moved to another position:

```javascript
const coordinates = {
  source: { fromPosition: 0, fromColumnId: 1 },
  destination: { toPosition: 1, toColumnId: 2 },
};

console.log(isMovingAColumnToAnotherPosition(coordinates)); // Output: true
console.log(isMovingACardToAnotherPosition(coordinates)); // Output: true
```

## Important Notes

- **Input Validation**: Ensure that the input event and board structures conform to the expected format for accurate processing.
- **Dependencies**: This module assumes a board structure where each column contains an array of cards.
- **Testing**: The module has been unit-tested using Jest to ensure each function performs as intended. You can run tests using the following command:

```bash
jest
```

By utilizing this module, you can effectively manage the drag-and-drop functionality associated with your board interface.
