# CardAdder Component

## Overview
The `CardAdder` component is a simple interface that allows users to add new cards to a specified column within a kanban board. It presents a button to initiate the card creation and subsequently displays a form for users to input the card details. Upon confirmation, it invokes a callback function, passing the newly created card data along with the corresponding column information.

## Key Components
- **CardAdder**: The main component that houses logic for adding a new card. 
- **CardForm**: A sub-component responsible for rendering the input fields for card title and description.

## Installation/Setup Requirements
To use the `CardAdder` component, ensure you have the following:
- A React environment set up (compatible with React 16.8 or above due to hooks usage).
- Any dependencies related to the component should be installed (e.g., testing libraries if you're running tests).

## Usage Examples
Below is a basic usage of the `CardAdder` component within a column.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import CardAdder from './components/CardAdder';

function Column({ column }) {
    const handleConfirm = (column, card) => {
        console.log(`Added card to column ${column.id}:`, card);
        // Logic to add the card to the corresponding column
    };

    return (
        <div>
            <h3>Column {column.id}</h3>
            <CardAdder column={column} onConfirm={handleConfirm} />
            {/* Other column-related components */}
        </div>
    );
}
```

### Important Features
- **Dynamic Rendering**: The component conditionally renders a button or a form based on the state of card addition.
- **Callbacks**: It accepts an `onConfirm` function prop that receives the new card details and the column reference when a card is added.

## Configuration and Important Notes
- The `CardAdder` component internally manages its state to show/hide the card form.
- The `onConfirm` prop must be a function capable of handling two inputs: the column object and the new card data. Ensure this function is implemented in the parent component for functionality.
- Users can cancel the card addition, which will not trigger the `onConfirm` callback.

### Testing the Component
The component includes tests using `react-testing-library` to verify its functionality:

- Verifies that the button to add a new card renders.
- Tests the visibility of the card input fields upon clicking the button.
- Ensures the `onConfirm` prop gets called with correct parameters when the card is confirmed.
- Checks that the input fields hide and the button reappears as expected on canceling or confirming.

This ensures reliability in user interaction and component functionality.
