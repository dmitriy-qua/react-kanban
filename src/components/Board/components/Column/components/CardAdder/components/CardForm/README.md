# CardForm Component

## Overview

`CardForm` is a React component designed to provide a user interface for adding new cards within a column of a kanban board. It allows users to input a title and description for the card and supports confirming or canceling the action. This component utilizes `React hooks` for managing input references and incorporates a clean, user-friendly layout.

## Key Components

- **CardForm**: 
  - **Props**:  
    - `onConfirm` (function): Callback function to be called with card details when the user confirms the input.
    - `onCancel` (function): Callback function to be called when the user cancels the action.
  - **Responsibilities**:
    - Renders a form with input fields for the card title and description.
    - Handles submission of the form, validates inputs, and triggers the appropriate callbacks.
    - Provides visual feedback by auto-focusing the title input field upon rendering.

## Installation/Setup Requirements

To use the `CardForm` component, ensure you have the necessary dependencies for a React project. Here are the basic steps:

1. **Install React**: Make sure you have React installed in your project. You can install it via npm:

   ```bash
   npm install react
   ```

2. **Install React Testing Library** (if you are running tests):
   
   ```bash
   npm install @testing-library/react
   ```

## Usage

Here is an example of how to use the `CardForm` component within your application:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import CardForm from './path/to/CardForm';

function App() {
  const handleConfirm = (cardData) => {
    console.log('Card added:', cardData);
    // Handle card data, e.g., save it to the state or send it to a server
  };

  const handleCancel = () => {
    console.log('Card addition cancelled');
    // Handle cancellation of card addition
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Kanban Board</h1>
      <CardForm onConfirm={handleConfirm} onCancel={handleCancel} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Important Features

- **Input Validation**: The form validates that a title has been provided. If the title field is empty, the form will not submit.
- **Cancel Functionality**: Users can cancel the addition of a new card, which triggers the `onCancel` callback without submitting any data.

### Configuration Notes

- The input fields have default values: "Title" for the title field and "Description" for the description field. You may modify these default values as necessary by using the `defaultValue` attribute directly in the `CardForm` component.
- The component uses `useRef` to manage the input fields, ensuring efficient access to their values during submission without uncontrolled component re-renders.

## Testing

The `CardForm` component comes with a set of unit tests written with the React Testing Library. The tests ensure that the component behaves as expected in various scenarios. You can run the tests with:

```bash
npm test
```

- The tests cover rendering of inputs, focusing on the title input, handling valid and invalid submissions, and testing the cancel action.

**Important:** Ensure that you run the tests within your project setup to validate the component's functionality.
