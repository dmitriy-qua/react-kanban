# ColumnAdder Component

## Overview
The `ColumnAdder` component is a part of a Kanban-style board that allows users to dynamically add new columns. By providing an interactive interface for users to input column titles, this component enhances the usability and functionality of the overall board application. Users can toggle between the display of a placeholder button and a form for inputting the column name.

## Key Components
- **ColumnAdder**: 
  - The main component that handles the logic for adding a new column. It manages the state to determine whether to display the column form or the placeholder button.
  - **Props**: 
    - `onConfirm`: A function that is called when the user successfully adds a new column and confirms the title.

- **ColumnForm**: 
  - A child component that presents an input field to the user for entering the new column title, along with confirm and cancel options.
  
## Installation
To include the `ColumnAdder` component in your React project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**: Ensure you have the required files in your project directory.
2. **Install Dependencies**: If using a package manager, run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   Or if you are using yarn:
   ```bash

   ```

3. **Import the Component**: In your desired React component, import `ColumnAdder`:

   ```

## Usage
To use the `ColumnAdder` component, include it in your render method while providing a callback function for the `onConfirm` prop:

```javascript
function handleAddColumn(title) {
  console.log("Column added with title:", title);
}

function MyBoardComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Kanban Board</h1>
      <ColumnAdder onConfirm={handleAddColumn} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Important Features
- **Dynamic UI**: The component toggles between a button for adding a column and a form for inputting the new column title, enhancing user interaction.
- **Confirm and Cancel Options**: Users can confirm the addition by clicking on the "Add" button, or they can cancel the action without making changes.

## Configuration and Important Notes
- The `ColumnAdder` component relies on external styles and potentially a parent component to define specific layouts. Ensure to tailor its styling to maintain consistency with your application's design.
- The `onConfirm` function should be designed to handle the new column titles appropriately, whether for state updates, API calls, or integration with a parent component state management.
