# ColumnForm Component

## Overview

The `ColumnForm` component is a part of a Kanban board application that provides functionality to add new columns. It presents a form that allows users to input a column title and submit the information. This component is designed to manage user input effectively by handling form submissions and cancellations, while offering a user-friendly experience with essential feedback mechanisms.

## Key Components and Responsibilities

- **ColumnForm**: The main component responsible for rendering the form to input a new column title. It utilizes React's refs for accessing the input field and provides two primary functionalities:
  - **onConfirm**: A callback function triggered when the user submits a valid column title.
  - **onCancel**: A callback function invoked when the user cancels the action.

### Component Structure

```javascript
function ColumnForm({ onConfirm, onCancel }) {
  ...
}
```

- **addColumn Function**: Handles form submission and prevents the default action. It calls the `onConfirm` function if the input value is not empty.

## Installation/Setup Requirements

To use the `ColumnForm` component, ensure that you have the following environment set up:

1. **React**: Version 16.8 or higher (for hooks compatibility).
2. **React Testing Library**: For testing the component.
3. **@services/utils**: This module must be available in your project for the `when` utility function.

```bash
npm install react@^16.8 react-dom@^16.8
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react
```

## Usage Examples and Important Features

### Basic Usage

To include the `ColumnForm` in your application, you can import it and pass the required `onConfirm` and `onCancel` props as shown below:

```javascript
import ColumnForm from './components/ColumnForm';

const handleConfirm = (title) => {
  console.log("New Column Title:", title);
  // Logic to handle the new column creation
};

const handleCancel = () => {
  console.log("Column creation cancelled.");
};

<ColumnForm onConfirm={handleConfirm} onCancel={handleCancel} />;
```

### Key Features

- **Input Handling**: Automatically focuses on the input field when rendered.
- **Validation**: Ensures that the `onConfirm` callback is only called with a valid title.
- **Cancellation Functionality**: Allows users to cancel column creation, invoking the `onCancel` function.

### Performance Considerations

The current implementation uses `createRef` for input management. Consider refactoring it to use React hooks (like `useRef`) for better state management and performance optimization in future revisions.

## Testing

The `ColumnForm` component comes with a suite of tests implemented using Jest and React Testing Library. The tests cover the following scenarios:

- Rendering and focusing on the input field
- Successful submission with valid input
- Handling invalid input
- Cancel action functionality

To run the tests, you can use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

## Important Notes

- The component is currently using `createRef` for managing input, which is marked for improvement with hooks.
- Consider validating the input further (e.g., length, allowed characters) depending on application requirements.

By integrating `ColumnForm` into your Kanban application, you enhance the user interface and improve the overall experience of adding new columns efficiently.
