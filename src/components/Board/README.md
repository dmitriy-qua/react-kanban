# Board Component

## Overview
The `Board` component serves as the central hub for a draggable card UI, allowing users to manage columns and cards within a dynamic interface. It implements the drag-and-drop functionality using the `react-beautiful-dnd` library, enabling smooth user interactions with the kanban board. The component supports various actions such as adding, removing, and renaming columns and cards.

## Key Components
- **Board**: The main component responsible for rendering the overall board structure and managing state related to columns and cards.
- **Column**: Represents individual columns within the board, where cards reside.
- **ColumnAdder**: A component that allows users to add new columns to the board.
- **DefaultColumnHeader**: Displays the title for each column.
- **DefaultCard**: Represents each card within a column.
- **withDroppable**: A higher-order component that provides droppable functionality for the board.

### Responsibilities:
- Managing state for columns and cards.
- Handling drag-and-drop actions seamlessly.
- Rendering child components for columns and cards.
- Providing user interactions for column and card management.

## Installation/Setup Requirements
To set up the `Board` component in your project, ensure you have the necessary dependencies:

1. Ensure that you have `react`, `react-dom`, and `react-beautiful-dnd` installed in your project.
2. Import the `Board` component into your desired file with:
   ```javascript
   import Board from './path/to/Board';
   ```

## Usage Example
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the `Board` component within your application:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import Board from './components/Board';

const ExampleApp = () => {
  const initialColumns = [
    { id: 'column-1', title: 'Todo', cards: [] },
    { id: 'column-2', title: 'In Progress', cards: [] },
  ];

  return (
    <Board initialColumns={initialColumns} />
  );
};

export default ExampleApp;
```

### Important Features
- **Drag and Drop Functionality**: The component allows users to intuitively drag and drop both columns and cards. 
- **Column Management**: Users can add and remove columns from the board dynamically.
- **Card Management**: Each column can have multiple cards with functionalities for adding, editing, and removing.

### Configuration and Important Notes
- The `initialColumns` prop is required to define the starting state of the board. It should be an array with objects containing `id`, `title`, and `cards` properties.
- Customization of card appearance can be achieved through the `DefaultCard` component. You may define your own styles or layout based on your design requirements.
- Make sure to handle the drop boundaries correctly to ensure a smooth user experience.

### Callback Functions
The `Board` component provides various callback functions for managing state changes:
- `handleOnDragEnd`: This function manages the logic once a drag event is completed. Ensure you define your logic to update the state based on the drag destination.
- You can define handlers for column add, remove, and card management like `handleColumnAdd`, `handleColumnRemove`, `handleCardAdd`, etc.

By following these guidelines, you can quickly set up and customize your kanban board experience using the `Board` component.
