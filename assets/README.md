# Assets Directory Documentation

## Overview
The `assets` directory contains scripts and styles for rendering a Kanban board interface using React. The main function of the provided code is to initialize and render a `Board` component that displays a collection of columns, each containing various task cards. This interface provides a visual representation of tasks organized by their statuses (e.g., Backlog, Doing). 

## Key Components
- **Board**: The primary component responsible for rendering the Kanban board layout, including columns and cards.
- **getUrlParams**: A utility function designed to retrieve URL parameters that may be used to customize the board on load.
- **Styles**: The directory also includes associated styles in `styles.scss` that dictate the visual presentation of the board.

### Responsibilities:
- The `Board` component receives an `initialBoard` prop, which defines the layout of the Kanban board, and several event handlers (for column and card manipulation).
- The `getUrlParams` function is utilized to obtain configurable parameters from the URL, enhancing the board's dynamic capabilities.

## Installation/Setup Requirements
1. Ensure you have **Node.js** installed on your machine. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Clone the repository that contains this code, or navigate to the project root if already cloned.
3. Install the required dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Once installed, ensure any additional setup related to the project structure, such as configurations for build tools, is correctly defined.

## Usage Example
To run the application that utilizes the `assets/index.js`, make sure to include it in your main application file (e.g., `index.html`):

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="src/styles.scss">
    <title>Kanban Board</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="app"></div>
    <script src="assets/index.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

### Important Features
- **Dynamic Columns**: The board supports multiple columns that can be dynamically generated based on the `initialBoard` prop.
- **Card Interaction**: Event handlers such as `onColumnRemove`, `onColumnRename`, and `onCardRemove` are available for handling user interactions, allowing for customizable behavior.
- **URL Parameter Handling**: By using parameters from the URL, the board can adapt its initialization based on user requirements or stored states.

## Configuration and Important Notes
- The initial structure of the `board` object must be maintained, as it defines how columns and cards are rendered. Ensure that the id used in the cards and columns is unique within the board.
- Consider adding further functionalities for handling state updates and persistence (e.g., saving to local storage or integrating with a backend service).
- All style configurations are contained within `src/styles.scss`. It is advisable to maintain the naming conventions used within this file for compatibility with the components.

For any issues or contributions, please refer to the project's contribution guidelines or issue tracker.
