# React Kanban

## Overview

React Kanban is a flexible and dynamic drag-and-drop Kanban board component built using React. By leveraging the capabilities of React, React DOM, and React Is, it allows for the creation of visually appealing and functional project management tools. This component facilitates the organization of tasks into columns, enabling users to easily manage their workflows.

## Key Components and Responsibilities

- **Columns**: Represent different stages of a workflow (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).
- **Cards**: Represent individual tasks that can be moved between columns.
- **Drag and Drop Functionality**: Support for dragging cards across columns for intuitive task management.
- **Public API**: Functions to add, remove, or reorder cards and columns, making integration straightforward.

## Installation

To install React Kanban, you can use npm or yarn. Hereâ€™s how:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install react-kanban

# Using yarn
yarn add react-kanban
```

Ensure you have React and React DOM in your project dependencies as they are required for the component to function properly.

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use React Kanban in your project:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import ReactKanban from 'react-kanban';

const initialData = {
  columns: [
    {
      id: 'column-1',
      title: 'To Do',
      cards: [
        { id: 'card-1', title: 'Task 1' },
        { id: 'card-2', title: 'Task 2' }
      ]
    },
    {
      id: 'column-2',
      title: 'In Progress',
      cards: []
    },
    {
      id: 'column-3',
      title: 'Done',
      cards: []
    }
  ]
};

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Kanban Board</h1>
      <ReactKanban data={initialData} />
    </div>
  );
};

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

### Important Features

- **Add Card**: Easily add new tasks to any column.
- **Remove Card**: Delete tasks when they are no longer needed.
- **Drag and Drop**: Move tasks between columns effortlessly to update their status.
  
## Configuration and Important Notes

1. **Data Structure**: Ensure the initial data provided to the `ReactKanban` component follows the given structure. Each column must have an `id`, a `title`, and a list of `cards`.
   
2. **State Management**: You may want to manage column and card state at a higher level in your component hierarchy to persist changes and handle data synchronization (e.g., with a backend).

3. **Customization**: You can extend or modify the provided functionality. The component can be styled with custom CSS to fit your application's theme.

For detailed functionality, you may check the source code or the component documentation as needed.
